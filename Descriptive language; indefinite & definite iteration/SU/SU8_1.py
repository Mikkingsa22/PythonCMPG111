##You need to provide a sequence of numbers that will allow you to experiment with the for loop

pos_intiger = int(input("Please enter any positive integer: "))##asking user to enter positive integer
for pos_intiger in range (pos_intiger-1, -1, -1): ##using for loop to display the integers in descending order

                 print(pos_intiger,end=" ") ##printing the result
